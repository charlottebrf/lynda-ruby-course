# Code the Cube ^-^
# Build your Cube without using the initialize function
# Your cube needs the following:
	# side = an integer representing the length of the side of the cube
	# get_side = a function to return side
	# set_side = a function accepting an int; set side to that int


#instructions
# Create a public class called Cube without a constructor which gets one single private Integer variable Side, a getter GetSide() and a setter SetSide(int num) method for this property. Actually, getter and setter methods are not the common way to write this code in C#. In the next kata of this series, we gonna refactor the code and make it a bit more professional... Note: There's no need to check for negative values!

#old tests in kata
# c = Cube.new
# Test.assert_equals(c.get_side(), 0, "When not set, side should be 0")
# c.set_side(5)
# Test.assert_equals(c.get_side(), 5, "Should return 5")
