# Objects have classes
#
# Each concrete thing (object) == instance of a class (a general idea/type)
#
# "this is a string".class => String
#
# Objects == concrete instances of classes
#
# "this is a string".is_a?(String) => true
#
# Once a class is instaniated: an object is created from it
#
# Classes have many characteristics, but most importantly- every class defines a number of methods which are specific to this type of thing (e.g. a string)
#
# Every time a new object is instaniated from this class this new object "inherits" all of these methods
#
# Objects inherit methods from their classes - objects have their own methods attached to them
#
# 
# Writing classes:
#
# Think of objects as having two things: They know stuff, and they can do something with stuff (their own stuff as well as the stuff that gets passed to them)
